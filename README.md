# Diving into combinatiry parsing

This project is my attempt to work through [The "Understanding Parser Combinators" series](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/) by Ken Lamug, to understand what combinatory parsing is, how it works and how it can be applied.

As a result I have created a small JSON parser with a minimal error support contained in only one file.

## TODO

- Parser needs to fully suport JSON format.
- Parser needs to start parsing with 'p_json_object'.
